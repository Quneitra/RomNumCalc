# RomNumCalc
This is my first program - a Roman numeral calculator, using the simplified rules for Roman numerals (addition only). It takes two numbers of any length, and can perform the four basic arithmetic operations as desired. Note that it does not return remainders for division.

Currently, this is very much a work in progress, with the program only able to do one operation at a time, but I hope to be able to expand it in the future.
